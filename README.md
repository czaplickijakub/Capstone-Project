# Capstone-Project
A collection of scripts used within the capstone project

## NOTE
The shell scripts used a modified version of inference.py found at [IQA-PyTorch](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch/tree/main). This code was modified slightly to allow pointing the script to a folder for batch IQA processing.
